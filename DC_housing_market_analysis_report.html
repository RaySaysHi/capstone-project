        <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
        <div class="executive-summary">
            <h3>Overview of Key Findings</h3>
            <p>This comprehensive analysis of the Washington, D.C. housing market from 2000-2024 reveals several significant findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The DC housing market has experienced distinct market cycles over the 24-year period, including a housing boom (2000-2006), bust (2006-2009), stabilization (2009-2012), recovery (2012-2019), pandemic boom (2020-2021), and rate hike era (2022-2024).</li>
                <li>Housing prices in DC show strong positive correlations with CPI (0.87), median household income (0.85), and population growth (0.64).</li>
                <li>Time series analysis confirms non-stationarity in housing prices requiring differencing for modeling, and reveals significant seasonal patterns with peaks in June and troughs in January.</li>
                <li>Unemployment rate changes lead housing price movements by approximately 10 months (correlation: -0.47), while housing prices impact interest rates and mortgage rates with a lag of about 2 years.</li>
                <li>Linear regression models with economic indicators significantly outperform time series and machine learning approaches for housing price prediction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Major Market Trends and Drivers Identified</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Growth Impact:</strong> Strong economic growth periods coincide with housing price increases, particularly during 2000-2006 and 2012-2019.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity:</strong> Negative correlation between housing prices and interest/mortgage rates becomes more pronounced with time lags.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic Drivers:</strong> Population growth and income levels show strong positive correlations with housing prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Resilience:</strong> The DC housing market demonstrated greater resilience during economic downturns compared to national averages, likely due to the stabilizing influence of government employment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary of Predictive Model Performance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard linear regression significantly outperforms all other model types with an R² of 0.9467 and MAPE of just 1.62%.</li>
                <li>Median household income (current and lagged) and affordability metrics are the strongest predictors of housing prices.</li>
                <li>Time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA) perform worse than linear regression despite their theoretical advantages for temporal data.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) show surprisingly poor performance with negative R² values.</li>
                <li>Linear regression correctly predicts the direction of price movements 85.71% of the time, providing valuable decision-making insights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Recommendations and Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Homebuyers:</strong> Monitor income trends and affordability metrics as the primary indicators of future housing price movements.</li>
                <li><strong>For Policymakers:</strong> Focus on income growth and housing affordability to address long-term market stability.</li>
                <li><strong>For Investors:</strong> Consider the strong relationship between income levels and housing prices for investment planning.</li>
                <li><strong>For Researchers:</strong> When modeling DC housing prices, prioritize economic variable selection over complex model structures.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression Superiority:</strong> The standard linear regression model significantly outperformed all other approaches, with the lowest RMSE ($9,773), lowest MAPE (1.62%), and highest R² (0.9467).</li>
                <li><strong>Time Series Model Limitations:</strong> Despite theoretical advantages for time series data, ARIMA and SARIMA models performed substantially worse than linear regression, indicating that capturing relationships with economic variables is more important than temporal patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Underperformance:</strong> Contrary to expectations, complex machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) performed poorly on this task, with negative R² values indicating worse performance than a simple mean model.</li>
                <li><strong>Direction Accuracy:</strong> The linear regression model correctly predicted the direction of price movements 85.71% of the time, providing valuable insights for decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Lasso vs. Ridge:</strong> Lasso regression performed better than Ridge, suggesting that feature selection is more important than handling multicollinearity in this context.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Model Robustness and Limitations</h3>
        <p>Important considerations regarding model performance and applicability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear Model Dominance:</strong> The superior performance of linear regression suggests that housing price relationships in DC are predominantly linear when appropriate features are selected</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Indicator Importance:</strong> The inclusion of economic indicators was far more important than capturing complex non-linear patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering Value:</strong> Well-engineered features like affordability metrics proved more valuable than complex model structures</li>
            <li><strong>High R² Caution:</strong> The very high R² (0.9467) may indicate some risk of overfitting, despite the model's strong test performance</li>

        <h4>Most Important Features in Linear Regression Model:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Median Household Income (lag 1):</strong> One-month lagged income values have the strongest effect on housing prices, with a coefficient magnitude of 97,547</li>
            <li><strong>Median Household Income (current):</strong> Current income values are the second strongest predictor, with a coefficient magnitude of 90,330</li>
            <li><strong>Payment-to-Income Ratio:</strong> This affordability metric has a substantial impact with a coefficient magnitude of 79,460</li>
            <li><strong>Price-to-Income Ratio:</strong> Another affordability metric with significant predictive power (coefficient: 65,698)</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> Calculated mortgage payment amount (coefficient: 55,674)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Income-related variables dominate housing price prediction, with the top five predictors all related to household income or affordability metrics derived from income.

        <h3>Relationship Between Income Growth and Housing Prices</h3>
        <p>Median household income shows a strong positive correlation (+0.85) with housing prices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Income growth has typically preceded or coincided with housing price increases</li>
            <li>The ratio of housing prices to income provides a key affordability metric</li>
            <li>DC's above-average income levels support higher housing prices compared to national averages</li>
            <li>Income disparities within DC create submarkets with different price dynamics</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Population Dynamics and Housing Demand</h3>
        <p>Population changes show significant impact on housing prices (correlation: +0.64):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DC experienced population growth of approximately 25% over the study period</li>
            <li>Periods of accelerated population growth (2009-2015) coincided with housing price recovery</li>
            <li>Demographic shifts toward younger, higher-income residents influenced demand patterns</li>
            <li>Recent slowdown in population growth correlates with moderating price increases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inflation Effects on the Housing Market</h3>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows the strongest correlation (+0.87) with housing prices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Housing prices have generally outpaced overall inflation during growth periods</li>
            <li>The recent inflation surge (2021-2023) coincided with strong housing price growth</li>
            <li>Real (inflation-adjusted) housing prices show more moderate growth than nominal prices</li>
            <li>Housing is often viewed as an inflation hedge, supporting demand during high-inflation periods</li>

        <h2>10. Housing Affordability Assessment</h2>
        
        <h3>Price-to-Income Ratio Trends</h3>
        <p>The price-to-income ratio provides a key measure of housing affordability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical average: 4.2 (housing price / annual household income)</li>
            <li>2006 peak: 5.8 (indicating severe affordability challenges)</li>
            <li>2012 trough: 3.6 (representing improved affordability after the housing crisis)</li>
            <li>Current ratio: 4.7 (above historical average but below 2006 peak)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mortgage Payment-to-Income Analysis</h3>
        <p>When factoring in mortgage rates, affordability shows different patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical average: 25% (percentage of monthly income required for mortgage payment)</li>
            <li>2006 peak: 35% (extremely challenging affordability)</li>
            <li>2012-2020 period: 18-22% (favorable affordability due to low interest rates)</li>
            <li>Current ratio: 30% (significantly reduced affordability due to combined effect of higher prices and interest rates)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Affordability Warning:</strong> The current combination of elevated home prices and higher mortgage rates has created the most challenging affordability environment since the 2006 housing bubble, despite income growth. This suggests potential housing market stress and increased risk for future price corrections.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Comparison with National Averages</h3>
        <p>DC housing affordability compared to national benchmarks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DC price-to-income ratio is approximately 35% higher than the national average</li>
            <li>DC experienced less severe affordability deterioration during the 2000-2006 boom</li>
            <li>DC showed more rapid affordability improvement during the 2012-2019 recovery</li>
            <li>Current affordability challenges are consistent with other high-cost urban markets</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Demographic Impacts on Affordability</h3>
        <p>Affordability varies significantly across demographic groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First-time buyers face particularly severe challenges with current price and rate levels</li>
            <li>Higher-income households (top quintile) maintain relatively favorable affordability metrics</li>
            <li>Middle-income households face significant constraints on housing options within DC boundaries</li>
            <li>Demographics shifts toward higher-income residents partially mask affordability deterioration in aggregate statistics</li>
